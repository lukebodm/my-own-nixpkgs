# My Custom Nixpkgs Overlay

This repository hold my own nix expressions that are not hosted on nixpkgs because they are either:
 - only useful for very specific projects (e.g. a specific compilation of a library)
 - my own personal utilities that are too buggy to release to the wild
 
Special thanks to drupol for coming up with this idea:
