# My Custom Nixpkgs Overlay

This repository serves as a template for creating your own collection of custom
Nix expressions, akin to what is done in `nixpkgs`. It includes a `default`
overlay that exposes all custom packages, facilitating their integration into
other projects.

This repository hold my own nix expressions that are not hosted on nixpkgs because they are either:
 - only useful for very specific projects (e.g. a specific compilation of a library)
 - my own personal utilities that are too buggy to release to the wild
